# creativity

<p>
    It is a repository created to present projects that were inspired online or even momentary inspirations.
</p>
<p>
    ./Funcoes-01 was created with the idea of ​​a JS course where I was studying functions with conditionals inside them. Its functionality is very simple, check the user's age and say whether or not he could access the files. A bit of DOM was also used to be able to manipulate the elements.
